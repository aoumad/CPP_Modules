## Subtyping polymorphism

Subtyping polymorphism, also known as dynamic polymorphism or runtime polymorphism, refers to the ability of a program to determine the type of an object at runtime and execute the appropriate method, based on th vtable of the object. It is achieved through inheritance and method overriding in C++.
